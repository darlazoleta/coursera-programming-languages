Sample code, my assignment solutions, and sample solutions for University of Washington's Programming Languages MOOC.

This repo contains sample assignment solutions. I collected them from the peer grading guidelines of each assignment, so that I could compare my own solutions against them, and reflect on whether there's an easier, cleaner, or more organized way to solve each question.

If you are a student currently taking this MOOC, please do not refer to them before first passing with your own efforts.
